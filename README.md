This project creates deep learning models for classifying tweets and anonymous facebook posts for depression. 
For the tweet dataset, we perform sentiment classification on depression. The tweets in the dataset are 
collected from across the world. For the anonymous facebook posts, the posts are collected using Facebook Graph API. It is a binary dataset with posts either about mental health or not.
